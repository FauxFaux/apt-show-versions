apt-show-versions(1) rewrite in C++
===================================
This is a rewrite of the original apt-show-versions in C++ using the
apt-pkg library from APT. It is about 100 times faster than the original
Perl implementation.

Changed behavior
----------------
* The following options changed behaviour:

    -R|--regex-all

        This option does not cause every argument to be considered a regular
        expression. It's only effect is to have specified regular expressions
        (with special characters like .?+*|[^$) match not-installed packages.

* The following options are not supported anymore:

    -r|--regex

        We are using the standard way for specifying package names on the
        command-line now, just like all other APT tools.

    -nh (short option only)

        This short option has been replaced by -n.

    -stf|--status-file and -ld|--list-dir

        Those options have been removed. You can manually set the following
        options via -o instead:

            Dir::State::status  (--status-file)
            Dir::State::lists   (--list-dir)

* The following options have been provided for compatibility purposes, but
  are actually useless:

    -p|--package

        There is no need to use this option, as you can just specify package
        names (and regular expressions) directly.

* The following options are dummy options that do nothing and are there for
  compatibility purposes

    -i|--initialize

        Not needed anymore

    -v|--verbose

        I don't really know what that option does yet.
